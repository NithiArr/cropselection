Thanks to KAGGLE.. you can find dataset here.. [DATASET](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/78c7595cbf5a98a8cc488e5b9f6911f216680e5a221e6704ba7be4d7ef42c753?resource=download)

# Features
- Nitrogen:It is one of chemical elements that become a part of amino acids. Plants synthesize nitrogen from soils along with other primary elements and turn them into amino acids. These chemical compounds are utilized by plants to increase the production and quality of crops.
- Phosphorus: It plays a major role in the growth of new tissue and division of cells. Plants perform complex energy transmissions, a function that requires phosphorus
- Potassium: Is is a paramount macro-element for overall survival of living things. It is an abundant mineral macronutrient present in both plant and animals tissues. It is necessary for the proper functionality of all living cells.
- Temperature:Germination is a miraculous event that involves a number of factors that include air, water, light, and, of course, temperature. Germination increases in higher temperatures â€“ up to a point. Once the seeds reach optimum temperatures, which depends on the plant, germination begins to decline.
- Humidity:Humidity is important to make photosynthesis possible. In the case of Anthurium, good humidity around the plant is more important
- ph Range:5.5-6.5 is optimal for plant growth as the availability of nutrients is optimal.
- Rainfall:determine how fast a crop will grow from seed, including when it will be ready for harvesting. A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to proper growth of crop
